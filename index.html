    <h1>Fate Of Kingdoms is an upcoming MMORPG Server for Minecraft</h1>
    <h2>Fate Of Kingdoms is a server that focuses on a complete Decision-based RPG experience in a massively multiplayer open world</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Fate Of Kingdoms story is about two kingdoms that have been <br>
      battling for many centuries, until one day, when a brave adventure <br>
      enters the lands and helps decide the kingdoms' fate. While playing <br>
      throughout the story and the open world, the player makes many decisions <br>
      that help to form the story, on which kingdom the adventure will help, <br>
      or if the player wants to go a separate way to form their allegiant and <br>
      take over the other kingdoms. While exploring the open world, the player <br>
      will experience many different cultures, quests, adventures, and other <br>
      players that also have a part in the story. As a player, you can collect <br>
      many different kinds of equipment, artifact, pets, cosmetics, and more.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>As of now, Fate Of Kingdoms is just an idea (I, a solo developer), will work <br>
      on it in my free time. I do not have much planned for Fate Of Kingdoms, but I <br>
      will work on it as often as possible and, of course, update you as much as possible!</p>
